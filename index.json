In recent years, most enterprise systems do not have the function of intelligent batch processing, and it often takes a lot of manpower and time to extract the target information in the file. These are very tedious and boring repetitive tasks.\nSolutions Use RPA+chatbot technology to develop an intelligent document processing and intelligent data analysis results. Use this technology to recognize complex textual information and customer needs.\nThe value we create For enterprises, reduce labor and time costs and improve work efficiency. For customers, increase customer satisfaction during the use of the system.\nUsing machine learning to analyze the sensor data from people\u0026rsquo;s activities Grade: 9.0/10.0\nRelated Course: Machine Learning for Quantified Self(ML4QS) - 2022 - VU\nJun. - July. 2022, Python\n| Github: https://github.com/TISNN/2022_ML4QS\nWork The focus of our work is to predict the activity of each subject by using sensor data. We followed the machine learning workflow from the book and processed the large PAMAP2 data set with good results.\nSolution \u0026amp; Innovation We labelled subject’s activity with different classification algorithms and conducted comparative experiments, the Optimized LSTM model had the best accuracy.\nOur innovation is that we use LSTM to deal with multivariate time series, depending on the complexity of our data set. We have also improved the model by adding the dense layer and dropout, which greatly improves the accuracy of the training and test sets.\nCreate a modular data processing pipeline using Brane framework Related Course: Web Services and Cloud-Based Systems(WSCBS) - 2022 - UvA\nApr. - Jun. 2022, Pyhton\n| Github: https://github.com/TISNN/WSCBS_Assignment4b\nProblem It is about using the Brane framework to implement a data processing pipeline. The pipeline is built for the Kaggle challenges \u0026ndash; Titanic – Machine Learning from Disaster.\nBrane framework The Brane framework uses containerisation to encapsulate functionality into portable building blocks in the form of workflow applications that perform specified work on multiple nodes distributed across multiple domains.\nIt addresses the challenge of running distributed applications on geographically dispersed IT resources. Scientists can write applications to compose their own data processing pipelines through the framework without having to deal with the underlying technical details.\nSolution Tiantic’s project has been divided into four packages:\nInitialization Get Features Train and Prediction Visualization Then they are composed into a programmable Brane pipeline.\nImplement a verifier with Constrained Horn Clauses Related Course: Verification of Security(VOS) - 2022 - VU\nApr. - Jun. 2022, Haskell\n| Github: https://github.com/TISNN/vos_hw2\nThe project is divided into four parts:\nPart 1: Horn Clause generation Provide an implementation for the generation of Horn Clauses from Nano statements. It should follow the method that use weakest preconditions and VCGen.\nNormalization: The translation to Horn clauses produces clauses that don\u0026rsquo;t fit syntactic restrictions. So it queries may contain expressions rather than just variables. The task is to normalize the clauses, such that they fit the restrictions.\nPart 2: Solving Horn Clauses via Predicate Abstraction The task is to implement the solving algorithm.\nPart 3: Verification The task is to verify a small suite of NanoJS programs.\nVerifier based on the weakest-precondition/VCGen methodology Grade: 10.0/10.0\nRelated Course: Verification of Security(VOS) - 2022 - VU\nApr. - Jun. 2022, Haskell\n| Github: https://github.com/TISNN/2022_VOS_hw1\nThe verifier based on the weakest-precondition/VCGen methodology was been completed by three parts:\nPart A: Verification Condition Generation Part B: Verifying A Small Suite of NanoJS Programs Part C: Add New Test-cases Programs that were written in a subset ECMAScript and translated them into the imperative language Nano.\nRecommender system: Personalize Expedia Hotel Searches Grade: 9.4/10.0\nKaggle Ranking: 12/233\nRelated Course: Data Mining Technologies(DMT) - 2022 - VU\nApr. - Jun. 2022, Python\n| Github: https://github.com/TISNN/Datamining2022\n| Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/2nd-assignment-dmt2022\nProblems The objective of the project is to explore a dataset provided by Expedia - an online travel shopping company, which contains 5 million search hotel queries by real users.\nIt is expected to leverage data mining techniques to train a model that can be adapted by the search engine to predict users\u0026rsquo; choices and rank the hotels based on the user\u0026rsquo;s history searching records and hotel information. Finally, to see the performance of our model.\nSolutions We used the scores of NDCG@5 from both the training and test sets for evaluation. When compared Random Forest Classifie, DeepFM, XGBoost and LightGBM, we find that the lightGBM model worked best with the training score 0.5244792 and test score 0.416901. And the score on Kaggle is 0.40851.\nUtilizing Multi-layer LSTM Model and Ensemble Learning Algorithm to Detect Fake News Related Course: Web Data Processing Systems(WDPS) - 2021 - VU\nNov. - Jan. 2021, Python, Pyspark\nBackground In the past many years, the development of information exchange lead to the rapid spread of fake news on the internet. Fake news may bring disastrous consequences and may plunge society into a serious crisis.\nTask In order to detect and eliminate fake news in the early stages to avoid social hazard and help people obtain the true information.\nThis project intended to use machine learning models (e.g., LSTM, Bi-LSTM) to establish a fake news detection system. Simultaneously, some optimizations (e.g., ensemble learning methods, trained classifiers) were made as well. The result of our test showed that our approach improved the performance of fake news detection on specific dataset.\nCR2: Scientific Communities Related Course: Large Scale Data Engineering(LSDE) - 2021 - VU\nSep. - Nov. 2021, Python, Pyspark\n| Visualization: https://billysen.github.io/\nProblem Our project is to process and analyze the metadata of academic papers from CrossRef to create a directed graph that represents the mutual citation relationship between different academic papers or journals. Afterwards, a list of scientific communities will be established by using specific graph clustering algorithm.\nA scientific community means a group of researchers who work in a specific field and regularly publish at the same venues (e.g., the database research community publishes at VLDB, SIGMOD, ICDE, EDBT, TODS, TKDE, and VLDBJ).\nSolution It is worthy to analyze the characteristics of the directed graph of each scientific community to find the writing habits and other characters shared by researchers in a certain subject.\nMeaning This project is quite useful and interesting. For scientific researchers, it is very necessary to understand the development and achievements of their research field.\n📕 Undergraduate Projects Using Different Deep Learning Models to Detect COVID-19 Thesis - Macau University of Science and Technology\nSupervisor: Dr. Subrota Kumar Mondal\nDec. 2020 - May. 2021 , Python\n| Github: https://github.com/TISNN/COVID\nPurpose The aim of this study is to build an early screening model using deep learning techniques to distinguish COVID-19 pneumonia from CT images of lungs in healthy cases, and to help doctors make rapid diagnoses and improve diagnostic eﬀiciency from an artificial intelligence perspective.\nMethods The publicly available COVID-19 CT image dataset.
